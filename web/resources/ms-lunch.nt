<music2> <description> "WATCH: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAAh4s5JrAs\n\nrecess album is pretty cool yeah\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/sssshawnnnn\nhttp://facebook.com/shawnwasabi\nhttp://twitter.com/shawnwasabi\nhttp://instagram.com/sssshawnnnn\n\nI changed my alias to Shawn Wasabi just recently! Most of you probably know me as sssshawnnnn, but I and most other people found it difficult trying to remember how to spell that. The reason I chose Shawn Wasabi was because it's easier to spell and remember, it's a lot more closer to my actual name, and it much more closely follows what I feel is the theme of my music. :) Just a heads up that I'll be posting music under this name from now on, thanks for being a cool fan!\n\nPlayed live on a Midi Fighter Spectra going into Ableton Live 8.\n\nTracklist(basically the entire Skrillex-Recess album):\n\nSkrillex - All is Fair in Love and Brostep (ft. Ragga Twins)\nSkrillex - Recess (ft. Kill the Noise, Fatman Scoop and Michael Angelakos)\nSkrillex - Stranger (with KillaGraham ft. Sam Dew)\nSkrillex - Try It Out (with Alvin Risk) (Neon Mix)\nSkrillex - Coast Is Clear (ft. Chance The Rapper and The Social Experiment)\nSkrillex - Dirty Vibe (with Diplo ft. G-Dragon and CL)\nSkrillex - Ragga Bomb (ft. Ragga Twins)\nSkrillex - Doompy Poomp\nSkrillex - Fuck That\nSkrillex - Ease My Mind (ft. Niki & The Dove)\nSkrillex - Fire Away (with Kid Harpoon)" .

<music4> <description> "Knock Madness available November 26th\n\nâ€œThe whole thing that got me here was controversy,â€� admits Hopsin. In 2010, the Panorama City, California nativeâ€™s back was against the wall. He was unhappily signed to Eazy-Eâ€™s former label with a debut ('Gazing at the Moonlight') failing to meet his artistic and commercial expectations after years of acting on a major network and a feature film. Hardly a â€œkiddie rapper,â€� the emcee took to the Internet and released, â€œSag My Pants,â€� an instant rewind. â€œI lashed out against Ruthless Records. I knew that would have some shock value. But at the time, I had to do whatever I could do.â€� Hopsinâ€™s survival mechanisms have guided him through life. As a youth placed in special education classes, Hop overcame the obstacles to become a video editor, music producer in addition to rapper. He is also co-founder of the low profile indie-powerhouse Funk Volume, currently with 600,000 Youtube subscribers and 1.2 Million Facebook Likes. This 2012 XXL Freshman is at the top of his class.\nIn the three years since 'Raw', Hopsin has steadily supplied his thousands of album-buying fans with free music, notably his â€œIll Mind of Hopsinâ€� series. The artist is still fearless in maintaining the spirit of lunchroom battles with SwizZz years ago; â€œI donâ€™t care to burn a bridge if I didnâ€™t want to cross it anyway.â€� In the meantime, he appeared on Tech N9neâ€™s video single â€œAm I a Psycho?â€� as well as a top 3 album by Insane Clown Posse, the Mighty Death Pop. â€œThe key thing is I donâ€™t hang around bullshit artists who convince me to make bullshit songs. I just hang in my basement with the same people Iâ€™ve always hanged with. Iâ€™m the same guy; I havenâ€™t changed.â€�\nWith cover stories and a plethora of seven-figure Youtube content, the self-made talent is sticking to his formula on his third LP, Knock Madness. â€œItâ€™s gonna be hard to topâ€”Iâ€™m calling it right now,â€� he boasts, claiming itâ€™s just â€œan enhancementâ€� of his work. Moreover, he wants to punctuate his career. â€œthis will probably be my last album for a long time.â€� elaborating, the recluse promises â€œthe biggest tour Iâ€™ve ever done, and Iâ€™m leavinâ€™ for a whileâ€� as devotes his attention to Funk Volume.\nWhile controversy may have made Hopsin a star, skill and courage made him a fan favorite. Hopsin has the attitude and charisma that makes hip hop unpredictable again." .
